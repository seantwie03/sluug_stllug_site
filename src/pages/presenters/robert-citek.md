A former St. Louisan, Robert currently resides and works in the Pacific Northwest, building and using Docker containers to solve bioinformatics problems for the Molecular Genomics Lab at Providence Health and Services.

When he's not wrangling data, you can find him hiking the local trails ( including Forest Park ) or cycling the many bike paths with his better half and her dog.
