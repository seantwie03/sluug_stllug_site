with Linux for awhile. He has been a regular participant and
contributor at the St. Louis Area Computer Club (SLACC) and the
Newcomer Linux Users Group (NEWLUG) meetings.He exhibits a rare spark
that comes with an intense interest in exploring Information
Technology.He has been constantly
exploring bash scripting, computer hardware, Linux distributions,
software tools and various network Operating Systems. Always
looking for what he can make the technology do and how he can make
the different systems work together.He did a presentation
for SLUUG on Penetration Testing some years back.Recently, he created a
PXE server to see if he could get it to work and try out different
distro installations without using a disk or a USB flash
drive.He also built a FreeNas
computer with a couple of virtual machines (Raspbian Desktop and
Ubuntu) running on it, along with a Unifi controller using a
docker, along with a Nextcloud server, and Syncthing running in
jails. This machine is also used as an Apple Time Machine backup
server.He turned a desktop PC
into a router using PFSense with ad blocking features, Dynamic DNS,
running a OpenVPN server, and VLAN(s) on it. He installed
BunsenLabs Linux Lithium distro on desktop computer the is 22 years
on. Also created a simple bash script using the zenity commands
that will ask the current logged in users if they would like to
update and upgrade their system.In a past life Wendell
drove 18 wheelers for 12 years.
