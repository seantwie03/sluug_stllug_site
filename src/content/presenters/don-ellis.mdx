Currently a member of
the SLUUG Board of Governors.
Frequent participant at SLUUG Steering Committee.Don has worked with
computers to varying degrees for a long time, measured in
generations on several scales, including but not limited to
generations of computers. He received training on the Lisa
(precursor to the Mac) that few people if anyone at Apple or
Microsoft has been given a hint of. He strives to find mentors who
can teach him and others more about how to use computers as power
tools to reduce the labor required to generate better (and
provable) programs.Don Ellis does stuff.
Sometimes amazing stuff. So, it sometimes pays to follow Don around
just to see what he found and how he makes it work.Don has at least one
cat.
