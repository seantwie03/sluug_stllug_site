Brian has been a member
of the St. Louis Unix Users group for decades. (Can it really be
that long?)First starting out as an
assembly language hacker on the Radio Shack Color Computer and the
Apple II in the 1970's, he found his love of C and Unix in 1984. He
also enjoys his Mac and his Windows computers (gasp) and is
currently interested in the TI MSP 430 architecture and assembly
language programming.Aside from computer and
business related activities, Brian enjoys hiking and camping
throughout the Missouri State and National Parks systems as well as
gardening to support native butterfly and bee
populations.His greatest
contributions to society are his daughter and his son, a mechanical
engineer and a programmer, respectively. Both are interested in
robotics.
