I work as an independent
consultant performing system and small network administration, and
writing specialized technical documentation.I have used Wireshark
and other tools for network packet capture and analysis for
problem-solving since 1979.I am new-ish to Linux
Mint, but have set up other Linux workstations since about
1998.I use fail2ban on a
client's mail server (exim4, dovecot, Debian stable) to drop 25 -
200 hostile packets/hour.I use fail2ban on a
client's webserver to stop OpenVAS and other pests.I run a mail server for
a client using Debian Linux, exim4, dovecot, spamassassin,
fail2ban, ipset, and iptables.
