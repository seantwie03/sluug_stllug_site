Steve Lembark has been
playing with computers for thirty years as a SysAdmin, DBA,
Programmer, and ETL analyst, Architect, and general beer drinker.
He is a principle AT Workhorse Computing.His experience with
shell programming started with DCL, since then he has survived
batch, sh, ksh, and bash -- hence the need for beer.Steve Lembark installed
his first RH distribution on a 486 using floppies cut by Eric Troan
in his garage, back when people told Eric he was an idiot for
trying to make money off of something that was "free" to begin
with. They also told Eric that nobody would use open source in a
corporate environment, companies wanted something backed by a "real
company" like IBM.Workhorse
