Currently a Lead Engineer for a
Medical Diagnostics company that was formerly a subsidiary of a
little airplane company named McDonnell Douglas. Am a member of the
Embedded Systems Development team, where we work with other
Engineering disciplines to develop Microbiological Analysis
instruments that (in the United States) are typically in hospital
Microbiology Labs.Experience in embedded systems began
with electronic prototyping, followed by CAD based printed circuit
board layout. This was followed by writing control firmware for the
systems I was prototyping (in assembly language), which led into
being involved in group projects that are primarily
C/C++.Additional languages I have dabbled
with include Python, SQL, HTML/CSS/Etc, PHP, Lua and
others.Have experience on various flavors of
UNIX/Linux, as well as Windoze.Education:
Associates Degree in Electronic Engineering Technology (Saint Louis
Community College 1985)
Bachelors Degree in Computer Science (University of Missouri Saint
Louis 2005 (ish))
Masters Degree in Computer Science (University of Missouri Saint
Louis 2010 (ish))
