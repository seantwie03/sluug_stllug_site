Robert Gundlach is a
relatively new user of the Linux operating system.I’ve always had an
interest in how things worked, but struggled with certain aspects.
I was always able to fix almost anything and I turned that into a
successful career in the commercial HVAC/R industry. While in that
industry I learned to build computers in the mid 80’s. With that
skill I ended up working with building automation systems. I set up
all of the hardware, but struggled with the programming end. I
worked with another person in my shop to assist me with the
programming. The proprietary software that we used ran on OS2 and
Windows NT. I’ve recently retired from that industry and finally
have the time to learn Linux.I just joined this Linux
and Unix users group in the hopes it will help with learning how
Linux works. Really enjoying the people and the knowledge I’ve
gained from joining this group (even though some of it is really
over my head). I enjoy working with media of all kinds and was able
to learn how to set up my own home theater pc. I first set it up
with the Windows operating system, but am now running it on several
Linux distros.I have two hard working
sons and a beautiful wife. My oldest son has two kids and we really
love having them over. Trying to get my grandson interested in the
Raspberry Pi. Also love working in my garden and walking my old
dog. Going to try and use technology in my garden.
