Steve was a Mechanical
Engineer that worked at Lockheed and consulted at Boeing. He is now
retired; but, has not quit studying. He is glad to return to
Missouri after years on the East coast.Steve likes to work on
problems where nobody has any solution in mind. In doing so, he has
done lots of work with generic algorithms and the use of
simulations. As a result he is the inventor of the first autonomous
aircraft router (used in military drones). His solution is based on
a genetic problem solving algorithm process used by plants and
animals to adapt to their environment. The technique involves
searching huge numbers of possibilities, similar to DNA sequencing
processes.Steve prefers to use
EMACS instead of other editors.Above all other things
Steve likes being married to his wife and working smarter not
harder.Steve has been know to
do presentations for SLUUG and frequently attends the SLUUG
Steering Committee meetings.
