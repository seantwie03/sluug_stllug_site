    'Where Is It?' a script base system to help you remember where you put your stuff and be able to retrieve it either by Number and/or Acronyms (of your choosing) Think of it as a customized Whereis cmd. Altho this custom command itself is useful, this talk will also demonstrate how such customization can be done.

    This will be HANDS-ON with git repository provided.

    Ever wanted a multi-purpose stereo system that can be managed remotely? One built from that spare Raspberry Pi? Well, .. my answers were affirmative, so I grabbed a Pi and got to work. [google](google.com) <a href="www.google.com">google</a>

    This tutorial will follow my creation of a Pi based MP3 player that could also be used for things like YouTube.
