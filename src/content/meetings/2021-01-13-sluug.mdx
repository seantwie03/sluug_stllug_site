'Where Is It?' a script base system to help you remember where you put your stuff and be able to retrieve it either by Number and/or Acronyms (of your choosing) Think of it as a customized Whereis cmd. Altho this custom command itself is useful, this talk will also demonstrate how such customization can be done.

This will be HANDS-ON with git repository provided.

Ever wanted a multi-purpose stereo system that can be managed remotely? One built from that spare Raspberry Pi? Well, .. my answers were affirmative, so I grebbed a Pi and got to work.

This tutorial will follow my creation of a Pi based MP3 player that could
also be used for things like YouTube.
