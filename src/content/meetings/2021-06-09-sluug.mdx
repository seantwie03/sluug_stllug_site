In a previous talk in February, we went over the basics of using git as a version control system, covering the working folder, the staging area, and the repository. In this talk, we'll go behind the scenes to see how git works its magic.

We'll cover the abstractions git uses, in particular, a key-value store, hashes, and graphs. And then dig into how git implements and uses those abstractions to create a version control system using files and the file system. We'll walk through examples of using the back-end commands to build a commit history just like git does. The hope is that by peering behind the curtain we can begin to demystify the magic of git.

A database is used to collect, store, manage, organize and analyze information. There are many database systems. This session will introduce simple database concepts. Then it will cover the free SQLite database system that is likely the single most popular and widely deployed choice.
