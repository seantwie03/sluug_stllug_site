        "alt": "Visualize a modern and professional blog post design with an emphasis on technology and open source. The background consists of a sleek, dark-themed gradient, transitioning from shades of blue to black. The foreground is home to various tech-centered logos and symbols. A generic tech logo, mimicking Intel's style and size, is placed prominently in the center. Around this logo, artistically arrange icons that symbolize open-source concepts, such as a penguin (representing Linux), a wildebeest head (for GNU), and an octocat (resembling GitHub). Discreet icons of a handshake and a group of people, symbolizing community and collaboration, are poised near the edges. Subtle tech elements like binary code, circuit diagrams, network connections trace around the edges to add a tech-focused aesthetic. The visual elements are displayed in contrasting white and blue tones on the dark background. The logos near the central tech logo are positioned in a semi-circle or orbit effect, with faint lines of code or circuit designs in the backdrop to add depth. This design will convey the theme of contributions to Open Source in a neat and engaging manner."
