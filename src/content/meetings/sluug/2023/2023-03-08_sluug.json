            "abstract": "Stan was planning, next up, to do a tutorial on the open source, cross platform LibreOffice BASE ( a desktop database front end ). It works with widely employed multi-user database engines: MySQL/MariaDB, Adabas D, MS Access and PostgreSQL. By default it uses an embedded HSQLDB ( Hyper SQL Database ) relational database.\nWell, that was the original plan. Then, Stan ran across a 30 minute video that clearly gave a much better, much clearer, more complete, more concise and professional tutorial than he could ever hope to give.\nWhat to do? Well, what then came to mind was to actually demonstrate using the two database tools that he had developed for SLUUG. Showing the flexibility, power and simplicity of these two in action could actually show why someone might want to explore using LibreOffice BASE.",

        "alt": "Design a professional and modern blog announcement image. The background is a mix of green and white, using gradients to simulate depth, growth, and freshness. The OpenSuSE logo is located centrally, sized slightly larger than the other elements for emphasis, while the Linux penguin logo is subtly included in the background. Icons from other well-known FOSS projects, like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins, are scattered around the OpenSuSE logo. A Yast icon representing a toolkit or a system control center is added along with arrow icons that form a cycle, symbolizing seamless upgrades and stability. Subtle tech iconography, depicting servers and data centers is integrated into the background, along with icons suggesting pathways or connectivity. The bottom portion of the image includes a clean, transparent overlay strip placeholder for event details."
