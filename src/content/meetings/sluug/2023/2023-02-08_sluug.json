        "alt": "Create a minimalist, technically-oriented image. The backdrop consists of a gradient blend transitioning from soft blue to white. In the center of the image place a large, open folder icon that represents dotfiles, with semi-transparent overlays of icons for typical files such as .bashrc, .vimrc, and .gitconfig. On the left side of the folder, place the YADM logo, and on the right side the Git logo, indicating their synonymous relationship, connected by arrows. Add subtle, dotted lines linking these logos to various dotfiles, suggesting syncing and alteration capabilities. Dispersed around the central folder, include small icons representing different operating systems like Linux Tux, BSD Daemon, to hint their use across different systems. Maintain original colors for YADM, Git, and system logos for authenticity, while arrows and dotted lines can be light grey or blue to keep the visual balance without overwhelming the key elements."
