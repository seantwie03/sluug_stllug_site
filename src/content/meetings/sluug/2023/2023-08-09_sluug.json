The backup from last night is, of course, all 20 databases (plus a few), so it is not possible to restore just one.\nCompounding that problem is that MySQL version is quite a few years old, and the backup cannot be restored to a current MySQL.\nInteresting problem? Tune in Wednesday to see how it was done!",

        "alt": "Create a visually appealing layout for a blog post image. Use a modern gradient background transitioning from a soft blue on the left to a deeper blue on the right. On the left side, place an image of a dolphin that signifies a popular database system, surrounded by subtle database icons for depth. Incorporate the concept of backup and restore with an icon featuring a server stack and an arrow indicating a restore process. On the right side, display a logo denoting a text editor in green, along with a split-screen graphic filled with code snippets, mimicking the side-by-side editing feature. In the center, leave a merging area that subtly signifies the connection between the two technologies, without any text. Preserve plenty of white space for a clean, professional look. All logos and icons should be high-quality, clean vector graphics to maintain sharpness and detail."
