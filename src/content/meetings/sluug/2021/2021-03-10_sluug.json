Perl 6 took YEARS in anticipation and when it finally came out, it was very different from older versions of Perl. So much so, they gave up on the name Perl 6 and just went with a new name, RAKU.\nRaku is considered to have tried to 'take the best' of all other programming languages.",

        "alt": "Craft a futuristic, technology-oriented image with a dark, sleek background. Elements of digital grid or intricate circuit designs softly glowing add to the cybernetic vibe. On one side of the composition, exhibit a vibrant, star-like symbol adding contrast, while on the opposite end, manifest a keyhole within a circle symbol. The central design element should depict an abstract representation of data flow or information exchange, possibly through code lines, binary digits, or holographic interconnected nodes. Accentuate the image with soft glowing highlights in blues and greens around these crucial elements, against the dark backdrop. Incorporate floating digital shards or holographic overlays for depth and movement. Ensure the design guides the viewer's eye from the star symbol, through the data flow, to the keyhole, narrating a connection between programming and cybersecurity."
