            "abstract": "PXE allows booting without having the operating system on a local disk...or for that matter...not even having a local disk!\nThe Preboot eXecution Environment, PXE (most often pronounced as /Ààp…™ksiÀê/ pixie) specification describes a standardized client‚Äìserver environment that boots a software assembly, retrieved from a network, on PXE-enabled clients. On the client side it requires only a PXE-capable network interface controller (NIC), and uses a small set of industry-standard network protocols such as DHCP and TFTP.\nThe concept behind the PXE originated in the early days of protocols like BOOTP/DHCP/TFTP, and as of 2015 it forms part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard. In modern data centers, PXE is the most frequent choice [1] for operating system booting, installation and deployment.",

        "alt": "Design a tech-themed image with a central figure of a large, glowing RJ-45 plug emitting digital streams in a cyan glow against a dark gradient background transitioning from navy to black. Situate the PXE logo near the network cable, subtly blended with digital streams. Place the pfsense logo next to a firewall icon, connected to the PXE logo through a digital pathway. Introduce the FreeNAS/TrueNAS logo as part of a server silhouette, linked to the network stream to indicate OS image storage. Incorporate the LibreOffice Calc logo on a stylized grid overlay, indicating data entry and management. Sprinkle icons of DHCP, TFTP, and UEFI to reinforce the technical aspects of PXE. Use shades of blue, cyan, silver, and white to produce a tech-focused, clean look. Embellish the image with futuristic motifs like holographic grids, matrix codes, and network nodes."
