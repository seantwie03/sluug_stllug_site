Gitso is a cross-platform (Linux, OS X and Windows) graphical program to easily connect one person to another person's screen, keyboard and mouse. This makes it straight-forward to get help or give technical support.\nIn a simple two-step process, the person giving support first sets up port forwarding and firewalling on his end, if necessary, and starts Gitso to listen for incoming connections on port 5500. Then, the person looking for help uses Gitso to connect to the supporter's address (IP or domain name), making their screen remotely visible and allowing the supporter to use their keyboard and mouse.",

        "alt": "Create a technologically detailed image that reflects the essence of remote support, connectivity and collaboration. Start with a sleek, dark-to-light gradient background transitioning from navy at the top to vibrant blue at the bottom. In the center, display a glowing hologram of a tilted computer screen showing a stylized desktop interface. From the hologram, have subtle neon blue glowing lines radiating out towards various nodes symbolizing interconnected devices. Below the hologram, integrate semi-transparent holographic representations of a keyboard and mouse. Subtly incorporate logos of Gitso, VNC, and screen sharing into the connection lines, all semi-transparent with neon accents. Enhance the high-tech atmosphere with soft, diffused light effects around the hologram and logos, possibly with light particles or small data streams flowing within the lines. The image composition should be balanced, with a cool color palette of blues, purples, and occasional neon accents in greens or yellows."
