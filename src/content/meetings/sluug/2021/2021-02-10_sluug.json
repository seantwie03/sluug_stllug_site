            "abstract": "From its inception in 2005, git has gone from a version-tracking tool used by Linux kernel developers to a corporate mainstay for collaborating in teams on projects. In this talk, we'll go over the three main parts of a git project ( i.e. working folder, staging area, and repository ) and how to work with each. In the process, we'll touch on many of the git objects that make those parts ( e.g. files/folders, commits, branches, SHAs, etc. ). And we'll do that by creating and modifying a project from scratch, using git to manage the changes. By the end, you will have a good basic understanding of how to use git to work on your own projects to then branch into more advanced uses of git.",

Entering ‚Äúspeedbar‚Äù in the emacs command line causes another frame to be opened to graphically show the current directory tree which can be traversed upwards and downwards from the current position. It shows all of the files and directories and each can be examined with a single mouse click. If the file is not text but a jpg or pdf or some other file type an auxiliary program will be called to display the file in an emacs buffer.",

        "alt": "Create an image visualizing Tech Fusion Futurism concept for a blog. The setting is a sleek, dark digital space gradient transitioning from deep blue to black. The centerpiece is a large holographic representation of a Git commit history tree with nodes and connecting lines. Surrounding the tree are semi-transparent cards demonstrating a Git project's main parts (working folder, staging area, and repository), and small pulsating data points symbolizing git objects. On the left, there is a prominently placed Git logo and to the right, an Emacs logo blending into the aesthetic yet maintaining its significance. Nearby is a stylized folder icon representing Speedbar. All elements emit soft futuristic glows against the dark background, hexagonal grid patterns subtly included with thin, glowing energy lines racing across, connecting Git and Emacs together. This design reflects the essence of Git's structure and Emacs' file organization to resonate with the advanced open-source community in a sleek, modern and tech-focused aesthetic."
