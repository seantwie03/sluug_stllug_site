On one side of the terminal window, place a slightly tilted, engaging Linux Penguin logo, and on the other side, put a Git logo to symbolize integration. Add a subtle abstract representation of a magnifying glass icon over a command line near the terminal window to indicate the whereis command. Emanate soft neon lights from the terminal edges for a glowing effect and use dark shades with neon blue and green accents as a color scheme. Put subtle overlays of hexagonal tech patterns in the background to highlight the technology theme. Arrange all elements and logos in a balanced way to focus on the center and avoid overcrowding any part."

The background subtly transitions from dark blue at the top to black at the bottom, enhanced by a digital grid overlay, creating a circuit board-like feel. Central to the image, there's a finely detailed 3D illustration of a Raspberry Pi, placed at a slight angle to show off its ports and components. Floating around the Raspberry Pi are the logos of Raspberry Pi and YouTube, and a stylized musical note or MP3 icon, all interconnected by light blue or neon cyan lines symbolizing integration. Emanating from the Raspberry Pi, you see dynamic musical waveforms and notes, subtly glowing to signify its function as a music box. Adding to the futuristic vibe, there are holographic light effects around the Raspberry Pi and animated binary code sequences in the background for depth. The main color theme includes dark blue and black, accentuated with light blue, neon cyan, and white. The logos retain their official colors for brand recognition."

The background is minimalist, with a gradient from deep blue at the top to black at the bottom, signifying depth and focus. Faint binary code or matrix-style text cascades downwards, underscoring the tech-driven nature of the landscape. The foreground consists of two primary elements. The first - an abstract representation of a classic terminal window with color-coded text and unique symbols symbolizing a customized 'whereis' Project. A diagram of digital icons showcases organization. The second - a Raspberry Pi enveloped by digital music notes and waveforms to signify a Hand Held Music Box. A faint outline of a remote control signal implies remote management capabilities. Incorporate logos of Linux and Git, along with sleek, high-tech interfaces like holographic displays and digital touchpads. Hexagonal shapes softly dispersed in the background add a modern touch. Use cool tones and gradients throughout, with a mild glow effect around the main elements. Add subtle illustrations of network nodes or interconnecting lines to represent collaboration and community. Insert a digital clock or calendar to highlight the ongoing nature of the workspace."
