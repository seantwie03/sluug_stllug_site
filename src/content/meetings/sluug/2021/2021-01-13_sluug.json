        "alt": "Create a futuristic and technology-infused image that represents a digital workspace or a lab environment. The background is minimalist, with a gradient from deep blue at the top to black at the bottom, signifying depth and focus. Faint binary code or matrix-style text cascades downwards, underscoring the tech-driven nature of the landscape. The foreground consists of two primary elements. The first - an abstract representation of a classic terminal window with color-coded text and unique symbols symbolizing a customized 'whereis' Project. A diagram of digital icons showcases organization. The second - a Raspberry Pi enveloped by digital music notes and waveforms to signify a Hand Held Music Box. A faint outline of a remote control signal implies remote management capabilities. Incorporate logos of Linux and Git, along with sleek, high-tech interfaces like holographic displays and digital touchpads. Hexagonal shapes softly dispersed in the background add a modern touch. Use cool tones and gradients throughout, with a mild glow effect around the main elements. Add subtle illustrations of network nodes or interconnecting lines to represent collaboration and community. Insert a digital clock or calendar to highlight the ongoing nature of the workspace."
