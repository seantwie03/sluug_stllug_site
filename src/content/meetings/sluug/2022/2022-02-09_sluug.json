For many of our customers, SPARC and Solaris continue to be critical technologies and this talk will be focused on how Oracle has supported and will continue to support those customers into the next decade. This will be a technical discussion covering:\nSolaris Support Repository Updates (SRUs) - what they are and why they matter\nNew features in ZFS, including vdev device removal (has it really been 16 years)\nSolaris Analytics for fans of Grafana (Solaris Web Dashboard) and Prometheus (Solaris Stat Store)\nPlatform support\nSecurity and Compliance Reporting tools\nSolaris in the Oracle Cloud",

Why are they splattered all over my clean pristine home directory and other folders? Is there some strategy for managing them well? All these questions and perhaps many more will be attempted to be answered by this talk.",

        "alt": "Create an image laid out as detailed: The background should be a tech-themed gradient of dark blues and greyscale which includes faint illustrations of circuits or server racks. On the left side, position a non-specific tech company logo near the top, with images reminiscent of hardware architecture subtly blended into the background. Overlay it with icons that symbolize server updates, file inspection, analytics and monitoring tools, and cloud services. On the right side, display a graphic of a terminal window featuring command-line text like 'ls -a', and include icons for configuration settings. Include also a faded image of an old computer terminal and a directory tree structure in the background. Separate these sides with a faint vertical line or gradient. Use a color palette that harmonizes strong corporate tones (reds, blacks) with retro terminal aesthetics (greens, whites on dark backgrounds). Remember, no textual content should be included."
