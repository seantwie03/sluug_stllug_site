This database is both flexible and frustrating. We will go over connecting to the service, available tools to manage the data, managing the services and considerations required when building a server and dealing with schemas along with an example server for participants to use.\nLDAP (Lite-weight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate data about organizations, individuals and other resources such as files and devices in a network -- whether on the public Internet or on a corporate Intranet.\nLDAP is a protocol, and Active Directory is a server. LDAP authenticates Active Directory â€“ it's a set of guidelines to send and receive information (like usernames and passwords) to Active Directory.\nKerberos is used to manage credentials securely (authentication) while LDAP is used for holding authoritative information about the accounts, such as what they're allowed to access (authorization), the user's full name and uid.",

        "alt": "Design an engaging image that conveys the essence of time-efficient, organized backups. The background is a calming gradient transitioning from a light to dark shade of blue. In the center, there's a large, white open folder. Surrounding it are smaller folders or files, each labeled with timestamps like 'hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', etc. and color-coded. To the bottom right, there's a small, recognizable logo signifying data transfer, and to the bottom left, an emblem representing secure digital communication. Floating above all this are subtle icons of clocks and calendars, reinforcing the time aspect of the backups. This image will not include any text."
