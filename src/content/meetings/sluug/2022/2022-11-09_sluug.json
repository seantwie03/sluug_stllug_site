A slightly blurred background focuses the view on the central elements. In the central spot, a large logo implicitly signifying a code editor program should attract attention, surrounded by four smaller logos illustrating key aspects of coding: a lightbulb (indicating features that ease software development), an HTML/CSS snippet (denoting intuitive markup language editing feature), a puzzle piece (representing helpful extensions), and a palette (depicting customizable themes). Scatter subtle, abstract tech-themed graphics like circuit board patterns, code snippets, or geometric shapes across the background to increase their visual appeal. The color scheme should cover a dark mode aesthetic with soft blue, green, and purple shades matching the hues commonly associated with modern coding environments."
