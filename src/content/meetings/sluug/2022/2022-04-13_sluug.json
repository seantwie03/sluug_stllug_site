At the center, a stylized representation of a router is situated, with rays emanating from it symbolizing network connectivity. Icons related to pfSense, FreeBSD, DNS, DHCP, WiFi, VPN, and Firewall are logically arranged around the router. The image also contains undulating lines signifying network traffic management and subtle, Matrix-like code running in the background. The color scheme combines deep blues and greens for a sense of security, with bright whites and yellows serving as accents. Ensure all elements are symmetrically balanced and the PfSense logo is the most visually prominent."
