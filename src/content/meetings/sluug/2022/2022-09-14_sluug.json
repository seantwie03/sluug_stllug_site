Are there things that are referenced or pulled into what is seen on-screen, and will that 'visual presentation'...that 'format' be saved along with the content? And since the SysAdmin or Operating System guy is usually the guy doing back-ups at the system level, they will expect you to know the back-up strategy at the web=page level.",

        "alt": "Envision an image with the harmony of soft blue and white hues forming a tranquil cloudscape in the background, symbolizing the serenity of the cloud environment. In the center, depict a stylized image of a server, or perhaps a rack of servers, to signify cloud-based solutions. Towards the top-right corner, place a hint of a green abstract logo, similar but not identical to any existing brand to stay copyright compliant, subtly hinting at a particular cloud service provider. Near the bottom-middle, draw an endearing black and white bird with an orange beak, evoking the spirit of an open-source community but not exactly mimicking the Linux mascot. Sprinkle the image with subtle elements of network connection lines, indicating connectivity, and subtly incorporate visuals of a shield and a bar graph to signify robust security and performance. The color palette should relay a bright and inviting tone."
