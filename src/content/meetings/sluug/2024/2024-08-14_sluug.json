            "abstract": "Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a free and open-source virtualization module in the Linux kernel that allows the kernel to function as a hypervisor.  KVM requires a processor with hardware virtualization extensions, such as Intel VT or AMD-V.  KVM has also been ported to  FreeBSD in the form of loadable kernel modules.  KVM supports hardware-assisted virtualization for a wide variety of guest operating systems including BSD, Solaris, Windows, Haiku, ReactOS, Plan 9, AROS, macOS, and other Linux systems.  (extract from Wikipedia article)\nThis presentation will help you get started with KVM if you have never used it before, or have not used it for a very long time.",

Encircling this central server are smaller, recognizable icons that symbolize varying operating systems such as Linux, Windows, macOS, and BSD. The KVM logo should be prominently featured on the server, further complemented with smaller yet visible logos of Intel VT and AMD-V nearby. The backdrop should boast a gradient of gentle lighting effects with embedded circuitry patterns - indicating a sophisticated technological atmosphere. The color scheme of the entire image should be professional in nature, majorly involving hues of blue and gray, contrasted subtly with hints of green and orange. This image must represent the interplay of various elements that embody the theme of virtualization - thus appealing to beginners and tech professionals alike."
