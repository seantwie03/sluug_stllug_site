        "alt": "Design an image of a clean and futuristic, technology-centric background transitioning from deep blue at the top to black at the bottom, embedding subtle circuit board patterns that hints at technological complexity. The center visual, a large glowing futuristic padlock, will symbolize the security with semi-transparent circuits and connection nodes radiating from it to represent network connections and remote access. On the left of the padlock, include a glowing stylized symbol that resonates with encryption, while on the right, a symbol that signifies a tech-assistant software. Quietly situated in the top background, place an icon to signify remote access and cloud environments. Lastly, subtly scatter futuristic key icons in the background, signifying authentication protocols, and apply soft glows and neon-like highlights around the elements, coupled with subtle drop shadows to impart them a high-tech and a 3-Dimensional look. The final layout will have a deep blue hue at the top with a circuit board pattern and a cloud icon, the center will have a large glowing padlock with radiating circuits, flanked by the stylized encryption and the tech-assistant software symbols, and the bottom will be a dark gradient fading to black with additional authentication key icons."
