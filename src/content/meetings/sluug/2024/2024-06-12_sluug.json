            "abstract": "Are you just starting to 'sniff' to see what is going on at that network interface? Last month we showed an overview of how to start and 'get the feel.' This month, lets look at some specifics. (This is a tutorial, so if it seems a bit esoteric, we expect folks to ask questions. We hope for a good discussion.)\nOur mission tonite is to have Wireshark SSH to a system and run tcpdump remotely and send the packet data back to Wireshark on the client.\nTo do this, the client needs to be able to log into the remote system and gain sufficient privileges to run tcpdump without password prompts.",

        "alt": "Design a vibrant collage-style image that visually represents the concept of social media for a tech-savvy audience. The main background should be sleek and modern with a gradient from a dark to a lighter shade of blue or green. Incorporate various logos: a simple 'M' with a mammoth mascot, a colorful hashtag-like symbol, a game controller with eyes, a recognizable TV network logo, and a purple speech bubble with 'Live Stream' spelled inside. Arrange these logos in a circular or scattered manner, equally sized, around the center of the image. Enhance the techy feel by adding semi-transparent icons of computer-related items like code snippets, circuit boards, or network symbols into the background. Ensure a cohesive color scheme, incorporating shades of blue, green, and purple that complement the logos. Apply a gentle glow or shadow effect around the logos for depth and add light flares in the background for a dynamic, modern feel."
