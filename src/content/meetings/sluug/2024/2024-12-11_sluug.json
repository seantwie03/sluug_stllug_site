The background should consist of intertwining lines, nodes, and futuristic circuit patterns. A central visual element is a turtle made of abstract geometric shapes that appears to emerge from a whirlpool of different Linux distribution logos, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux. Add an overlay with the Docker logo on the lower right corner, resembling a digital hologram. Scatter iconic symbols of cybersecurity (padlock, shield, magnifying glass) subtly. Use soft lighting effects for cohesiveness."
