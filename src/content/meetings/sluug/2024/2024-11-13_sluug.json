I.E.- certbot (ie EFF's tool to obtain certs from Let's Encrypt) did not \"see\" the open port 80 visible in iptables -vnL!

        "alt": "A high tech image capturing the theme of containerization technology. Feature a gradient background blending shades of blue and green for a modern feel. Place a network of interlocking, transparent 3D cubes, indicative of digital containers in the center. Highlight a generic open-source project logo, slightly embossed, occupying the center position while giving reference to a well-known open source whale logo subtly on one side, slightly faded but still visible. Incorporate the logo of a system daemon, seamlessly integrated within the intricate network design. Add motorways of circuits connecting these logos and elements, illustrating their interaction. Place discreet icons resembling security shields around the image to symbolize enhanced security features."
