        "alt": "Design a clean, modern, visually appealing image with simplicity. It should have a smooth gradient background transitioning from light blue to soft green. At its center, include a large, simplistic 3D cloud icon. Beside the cloud on the left, display a simplified computer server icon, and on the right, place a simplistic hard drive icon. Incorporate sets of arrows indicating the data flow: one from the server to the cloud and another from the cloud to the hard drive. Add small, sleek monochrome logos of Tux Penguin for Linux and Puffy Pufferfish for OpenBSD at the bottom but semi-transparent to minimize their impact. Furthermore, integrate subtle icons of files, folders, and databases floating to depict the concept of data in cloud storage."
