We will cover how it worked from a high level, how it almost was a far more serious issue than it is, and what it means for the FOSS world. (Also why this issue is causing me to loose sleep over it)\n(This was noted in an ArsTechnica article on March 29 (ie ~ 20 days ago.) Same day, stlLUG members were posting it in our DISCUSS email-list. On April 11, there was a ~5min on-air interview with the MS engineer who discovered it, including comments about open-src vs closed-src. This interview was on the general public's NPR radio. The backdoor seems to have been loose in the public since at least Feb 23?)\nCVE-2024-3094.",

The image should have a gradient background transitioning from dark blue to black, symbolizing sophistication and ominousness. In the center, a high-resolution image of a lock that's half-broken with glowing red crack lines emanating from it should be placed, symbolizing compromise in security and vulnerability. At the top-left, subtly blend the logo of a utility unit and at the bottom-left, place a logo honoring open-source operating systems. A grayscale logo of a tech news site should be positioned at the bottom right. Overlaid faintly across the image horizontally should be binary code, representing underlying data. A shadowy image of a hacker should be blended into the background on one side, suggesting the undetected threat. Red accents or highlights around the broken lock and a soft white glow around the logos should be present to draw focus."
