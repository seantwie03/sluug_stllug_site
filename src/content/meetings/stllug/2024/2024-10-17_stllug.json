We will also cover techniques for applying these tools to an already existing code base, and how to integrate them into a CI/CD pipeline.",

        "alt": "Create a visually appealing image for a blog post titled 'Automated Code Review'. Background should be a subtle gradient from a soft teal to a dark navy blue to represent the levels of complexity in automated code review processes. Overlay an abstract digital grid or circuit board pattern, symbolizing the mechanisms of code review. Incorporate logos of ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube, and Travis CI or Jenkins, using appropriate metaphoric embellishments to signify their roles. Add an abstract code snippet flowing through a funnel or pipeline to denote transformation from raw to refined code. Use grid-like highlights or light beams for emphasis and maintain a color scheme of teal, navy blue, light grey and white with vibrant accents of yellow or green to represent success."
