Kubernetes is more extensive than Docker Swarm and is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner.\nKubernetes contains powerful functionality for orchestrating applications and guaranteeing service availability.  Rancher adds a complete UI and workload management layer to Kubernetes, that simplifies adoption and integrates CI/CD as well as key open source projects",

        "alt": "Create a futuristic and technological themed image with a sleek, dark background incorporating shades of deep blue and black. Include a subtle glowing network grid effect to signify connectivity and technology integration. At the center, place a green chameleon logo (while avoiding explicit reference to identifiable trademarks), subtly glowing for a cutting-edge appearance. On the left, place a little blue cow icon with a futuristic shine. On the right, add a ship wheel logo also subtly illuminated. Incorporate semi-transparent elements representing containerized systems as abstract shapes or icons. Integrate subtle visual effects like circuit lines and data flow animations around the logos to symbolize data interchange and advanced technology integration. Add a faint, white light at the top of the image, creating a halo effect around the logos."
