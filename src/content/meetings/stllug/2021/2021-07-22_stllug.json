        "alt": "Create an image that begins with a gradient background transitioning from deep blue to lighter teal shades, subtly adorned with light and intricate circuit board patterns to underscore its tech theme. To the center-right, position a large abstract reptile logo with a glowing effect, accompanied by a smaller but related sign, both set in blue and green colors. Introduce hexagonal structures and lines throughout the composition to mirror the nuances of network diagrams or blockchain graphics. Subtly merge in a representation of simplified futuristic salt grains, particularly around the glowing logos, indicative of a configuration management theme. Add subtle lens flares and ambient glows for an air of sophistication and futurism. Ensure to maintain a high-resolution for the picture suitable for various screen sizes."
