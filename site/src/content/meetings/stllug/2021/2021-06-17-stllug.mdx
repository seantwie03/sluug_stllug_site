Last month, I was able to get my hands on a new Ryzen 5900X processor and decided to rebuild my workstation. I decided that this time around that I would attempt to move my workflow to Linux. This is the story of my migration.

Of course, there was the need to get stuff from work to work...automated scripts sftwr, cmds to replace MS-Win cmds. But also wanted to get games to work!

That focus will be around games in the Steam, Epic Game Store & Good Old Games stores. I will also test the Blizzard Battle.net games.
