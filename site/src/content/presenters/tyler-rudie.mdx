Tyler Rudie is the Lead Code Monkey for Siemens Industry Software Accounts Department. Yes my code touched your user account when you got hired. He currently spends his days abusing the Python and Powershell so he can take long naps at work. So far no luck, management and coworkers keep finding him things to do. Demonstrating the core economic principle of unlimited want way to well. He has a bad habit of using overkill in most of his projects. One of these days he will get back to his Photography and Astrophotography hobbies.
